# 1. Naming Convention:
#   Camel Case, Kebab Case, Snake Case, etc.
#
# Camel Caseï¼š
#   The first letter of the first word of the variable name to be formed
#   by the combination of 2 or more words is written adjacently, with the
#   first letter of the second word capitalized, e.g., camelCase.
# Kebab Case:
#   It is written by separating the words of the variable name to be
#   created with a "-" character, e.g., kebab-case.
# Snake Case:
#   It is written by separating the words or characters that will make up
#   the variable name with a "_" character, e.g., snake_case.
#
# 2. def sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0):
#        repl can be either a string or a callable;
#        if a string, backslash escapes in it are processed. If it is
#        a callable, it's passed the Match object and must return a
#        replacement string to be used.

# 3. The groups() & re.MatchObject.group() method in regular expressions
# (1) groups()
#   This method returns a tuple containing all the subgroups of the match,
#   from 1 up to however many groups are in the pattern.
# (2) re.MatchObject.group([n])
#   This method returns the complete matched subgroup by default or a tuple
#   of matched subgroups depending on the number of arguments.
#   n: (optional) n defaults to zero (meaning that it it will return the
#   complete matched string)
